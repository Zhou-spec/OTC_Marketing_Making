# OTC_Marketing_Making
This repo is the code for my OTC market-making project. The OTC market-making project is one with the assumption that the market orders arrival intensity is linearly inverse to the bid-ask spreads. 
This setting is very nice because the optimal policy under this setting is Gaussian. However, this simple setting can generate very large bid-ask spreads, which is unrealistic. Future research will consider a more general setting.
